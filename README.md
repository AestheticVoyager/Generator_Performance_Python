# Generator_Performance_Python
A very simple showcase and example of performance gain by using generators in Python.

## Inefficiency of List Data Structure
Let's test our code while taking advantage of predefined list data structure.
It will comsume almost 300MB of your system's RAM and take more than 1.5 seconds to execute.
Quite undesirable!

## Efficiency of using Generator To Achieve The Same Goal
With some elementary modifications to the code, we reap the undeniable benefits of correct usage of Generators in Python.
Now the program will execute under 1 second while using less than 0.2MB of your RAM.
